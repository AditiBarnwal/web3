 How to become a Web3 Developer
(End Goal - Get a Job or start a Web3 Startup)
Roadmap
Don’t forget to make noise while learning (share your progress and the projects you build on discord communities and twitter). Keep a habit of learning by reading because many web3 projects are still early and don’t have proper docs. Which is also a good thing because you can help them instead.

Skills from Web2 that will help.
Typescript, NextJS, Chakra UI, Material UI, Testing.
Core computer concepts (operating systems, networking) and problem solving skills are fundamental and required no matter web2 or web3.
Differentiating Skills
Knowledge of Cryptography (ECDSA - Elliptic curve cryptography, Asymmetric key cryptography).
Remote Procedure calls is the base of blockchain (very helpful if you already know it), WebSockets.

Metamask (wallet) (use web3 to learn how it works)
this is a wallet used to interact with blockchain.
this is a very basic skill expected from a crypto user, however developer should know more than average user like how to programmatically request network change and detect current accounts and network.
have a look at its docs.
Solidity (new language) (EVM based) (For solana & near) (learn Rust)
Learn basics first the language is under very quick development new versions roll out pretty quick so don’t get overwhelmed.
Best place to start CryptoZombies.
Reading habit is recommended as most of the good tutorials are in text not in video format.

Solidity by Example (text based tutorial)
Intermediate Level
Solidity Docs
Read other people’s code.
Expert Level
Ethereum Docs
Secureum
Mastering Ethereum - Gavin Wood

Etherscan (Blockchain Explorer)
This is the blockchain explorer. You might think this is basic but there is a lot to learn here. A lot of people don't know how to read the transactions.
Learn all the terms mentioned in a transaction google them.
Learn by reading code of other popular smart contracts most of them are Open Source.
Learn how to verify a contract from explorer, learn how to verify using remix and then programmatically from hardhat.

Remix (online IDE for solidity) (beginner level)
Learn how to deploy contracts.

Hardhat (framework for development) (intermediate user) (widely used) (highly recommended) (Javascript)

Openzeppelin Contracts (EVM based only)

Anchor Protocol (Solana)

Brownie (intermediate user) (development Framework) (python)

Decide DeFi, NFT or DAOs (multiple is fine)
DeFi - Uniswap (decentralized Dex), Aave, Compound. Openzeppelin
NFT - Openzeppelin (ERC721, ERC20, ERC1155)
DAOs - Compound Governance, Snapshot
Metaverse - Decentraland, Sandbox.
